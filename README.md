Environment setup for the project to run (step-by-step procedures or commands)
	The virtual environment used to help run the program is pipenv. 
  This virtual environment was chosen because pipenv is one of the most basic and beginner virtual environments to set up and use compared to other virtual environments. 
  First, the version of Python used in each memberâ€™s computer was made sure that it was up to date. Pip was installed in the directory used to store the project. 
  This is used to install and manage the packages for pipenv. Django is then installed as this is the Python web framework that will help the programmers create the website. 
  Pipenv is then installed complete with its packages and requirements text for the packages required to run the project.
